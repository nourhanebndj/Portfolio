# Portfolio Nourhane Bendjeddou

This project is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my professional and creative work. It features a clean and elegant design, leveraging the latest web technologies.

## Technologies

Built with HTML, pure CSS, and JavaScript to test my knowledge on CSS grid layout, flexbox, and creating a responsive navigation bar. As mentioned, CSS grid and flexbox were used to build the layout and to assist in the responsiveness of the webpage, along with media queries. JavaScript was mainly used to toggle the menu icon for mobile screens.
